# DS6050_Codeathon_1

# Prompt
For this codeathon, you will build an image classification model using Tensorflow and the Keras. You will compare performance across multiple deep learning models to get the best performance. Leveraging this tutorial: Image classificationLinks to an external site. you will start with a basic Keras model using the Sequential API; compile and train the model and visualize the training results. You will then test the model on a separate test set. You will apply techniques such as data augmentation and dropout to improve the performance of the model. For the final step you will leverage transfer learning by selecting other pretrained models and use transfer learning to 

The tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:

Examine and understand data.
Build an input pipeline.
Build the model.
Train the model
Test the model.
Improve the model and repeat the process.
